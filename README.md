# Sudoku-Solver-Pygame-
A simple GUI-based program to play the famous pass-time puzzle Sudoku. It uses Python's Pygame library for GUI.

This self-based project was developed to put into application the understanding of data-structures and algorithms. 
This mainly uses the Backtracking Algorithm to solve for a given valid board. 

The project has the following salient features :- 
1) Allows the player to pen down a temporary value for a particular cell. 
2) Displays an additional cross-mark at the bottom-left corner of screen in case of a wrong digit placement. 
3) Displays the time that has passed so that player can improve the next time they play. 
4) Solves the board for the player in case (s)/he gets stuck and wishes to see the final solved board.
